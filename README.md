## Introduction 
In the vast realm of culinary ... ; We explore this central question:
> Do people tend to try recipes with lower saturated fat content more often than recipes with higher saturated fat content?
>

This research question seeks to explore whether individuals are concious about making healthy food choices when deciding on which recipes to try out. In essence, we are investigating whether recipes containing lower saturated fat contents are more popular amongst the general public than recipes higher in saturated fat. This research question may be of interest to people studying dietary habits and could provide insights into the factors influencing food choices in the ever-evolving landscape of nutrition and wellness.
<br/>

The dataset that we explore in this project contains recipes and ratings from [food.com](https://https://www.food.com/) that have been posted since 2008, with 83,782 different observations in the `raw_recipes` dataset and 731,927 different reviews/ratings the `raw_interacions` dataset. The columns from the `raw_recipes` dataset that are of interest to us throughout this project:

| Column      | Description |

| `'id'`      | unique ID of recipe |
| `'name'`    | name of recipe |
| `'minutes'` | reported time each recipe takes to make, in minutes |
