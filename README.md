## Introduction 
In the vast realm of culinary ... ; We explore this central question:
> Are recipes that are lower in saturated fat content more popular among people than recipes that are higher in saturated fat content?
>

This research question seeks to explore whether individuals are concious about making healthy food choices when deciding on which recipes to try out. In essence, we are investigating whether recipes containing lower saturated fat contents are more popular amongst the general public than recipes higher in saturated fat. This research question may be of interest to people studying dietary habits and could provide insights into the factors influencing food choices in the ever-evolving landscape of nutrition and wellness.
<br/>

The dataset that we explore in this project contains recipes and ratings from [food.com](https://https://www.food.com/) that have been posted since 2008, with 83,782 different observations in the `recipes` dataset and 731,927 different reviews/ratings the `interacions` dataset. The columns from the `recipes` dataset that are of interest to us throughout this project:

| Column      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `'id'`      | unique ID of recipe |
| `'name'`    | name of recipe |
| `'minutes'` | reported time each recipe takes to make, in minutes |
| `'nutrition'`| nutrition information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]; PDV stands for ‚Äúpercentage of daily value‚Äù |
| `'n_steps'` | number of steps to make recipe | 
| `'n_ingredients'`| number of ingredients to make recipe | 

Also, the columns from the `interactions` dataset that are of interest to us throughout this project:

| Column      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `'recipe_id'`| unique ID of recipe |
| `'rating'`  | rating (out of 5) of recipe given a reviewer |

## Cleaning and EDA
### Cleaning
#### 1. Merge DataFrames
The `recipes` DataFrame contains one row per recipe, and the `interactions` dataframe contains one row per review of a recipe. The `id` column in `recipes` and the `recipe_id` columns in `interactions` are common columns, and thus we merge the two DataFrames using a left merge on `recipes`. This results in a DataFrame `merged` with one row per review of every recipe that appears in `recipes`.
#### 2. Add Average Ratings
From `merged` we calculate the average `rating` for each recipe in the DataFrame. Before doing so, we replace all ratings of 0 with `np.nan` since a rating of 0 may acutually mean that the rating is missing if a reviewer forget to add a rating at the end of their review. Thus, we replace with `np.nan` to ensure that when calculating the average rating, we do not factor in missing ratings as a rating of 0. Then, we add these average ratings as a new column `mean_rating` to the `recipes` DataFrame.
#### 3. Add Number of Reviews
For our research question, we focus on the 'popularity' of a recipe. For the purposes of this project, we categorize a recipe's popularity by looking at how many reviews it receives, since we reason that recipes with more number of reviews have reached a wider audience, and hence are more popular. We used the `merged` DataFrame to calculate the number of reviews a recipe receives and add these values as a new column `n_reviews` to the `recipes` DataFrame.
#### 4. Seperate `'nutrition'` Column 
After checking the data types of the columns, we notice that the `'nutrition'` column, which is present in both `recipes` and `merged`, actually contains strings that are formatted as lists instead of actual lists. For both DataFrames, we separate the values in the `'nutrition'` column into seperate these seperate columns: `'calories'`, `total_fat`, `sugar`, `sodium`, `'protein'`, `'saturated_fat'`, and `'carbohydrates'`. We note that all these values are in PDV units, or percentage of daily value.
#### 5. Drop and Sort Columns
For the purposes of our analysis, we drop the `'...'` columns from `recipes` and the `'...'` columns from `merged`. We also sort the `recipes` DataFrame by `id` for organizational purposes.
#### 6. Cleaned DataFrames
Here are the first 5 rows of the cleaned `recipes` DataFrame:

|     id |   contributor_id | name                                  |   minutes |   calories |   total_fat |   sugar |   sodium |   protein |   saturated_fat |   carbohydrates |   n_ingredients |   n_steps |   mean_rating |   n_review |

## Assessment of Missingness
We used the `merged` DataFrame for the entirety of this section. Here is the summary of the missingness in the columns of `merged`:
....
### NMAR Analysis
We believe that the `'description'` column is NMAR because perhaps certain recipes do not have much to descibe, and therefore are left blank. For example, recipes for foods such as cookies or hot chocolate may not require much of an explanation, and thus their recipes are note accompanied by a description. We can collect data on how common each food item is, since we believe that more popular/well-known dishes may not need a description while more uncommon foods, like those that are specific to a culture, may be more likely to require a description.

### Missingness Dependency
From the missingness summary above, we notice that the `'rating'` column has a substantial amount of missing values as compared to the `'description'` and `'review'` columns. In this section, we conduct two separate permutation tests to analyze the dependence of the `'rating'` column's missingness on the `'saturated_fat'` column and the `'minutes'` column.
#### `'rating'` and `'saturated_fat'`
For this permutation test we analyze if there is dependency between the missingness of the ratings and the saturated fat content. We use the difference in group means as our test statistic, as `'saturated_fat'` is numerical. For this test, we have the following:
- **Null Hypothesis**: The saturated fat for recipes with missing ratings and recipes with non-missing ratings are drawn from the same distribution (i.e. group_mean(missing) - group_mean(non-missing) = 0).
- **Alternate Hypothesis**: The mean saturated fat for recipes with missing ratings is greater than that of the recipes with non-missing ratings (i.e. group_mean(missing) - group_mean(non-missing) > 0).

Here is the plot of the results from our permutation test using 2000 permutations:
....

We get a p-value of 0.0, which is lower than the significance level 0.05, and therefore we reject the null hypothesis. As such, we **can conclude** that the missingness in the `'rating'` column is dependent on the `'saturated_fat'` column. In other words, **we conclude that the ratings is MAR, conditional on saturated fat**.

#### `'rating'` and `'minutes'`
For this permutation test we analyze if there is dependency between the missingness of the ratings and the minutes each recipe takes to make. We use the difference in group means as our test statistic, as `'minutes'` is numerical. For this test, we have the following:
- **Null Hypothesis**: The minutes for recipes with missing ratings and recipes with non-missing ratings are drawn from the same distribution (i.e. group_mean(missing) - group_mean(non-missing) = 0).
- **Alternate Hypothesis**: The mean minutes for recipes with missing ratings is greater than that of the recipes with non-missing ratings (i.e. group_mean(missing) - group_mean(non-missing) > 0).

Here is the plot of the results from our permutation test using 2000 permutations:
....

We get a p-value of 0.1205, which is greater than the significance level 0.05, and therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis. As such, we **cannot conclude** that the missingness in the `'rating'` column is dependent on the `'minutes'` column. In other words, **we conclude that the ratings is MCAR with resepct to the minutes**.
